# Device Domain

**Device Domain** is a Spring Boot-based application designed to handle and process device data. It leverages modern Java technologies to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient system.

## Features

- **Spring Boot** for rapid application development.
- **Spring Data JPA** with Hibernate for database interactions.
- **MariaDB** as the primary runtime database.
- **Liquibase** for database migrations and versioning.
- **H2 Database** for unit testing.
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code.
- Full support for **Docker** to containerize the application.

---

## Requirements

To build and run this project, you need the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Java 21** (JDK 21 or newer)
- **Maven 3.9+**
- **Docker** (optional for containerized deployment)

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally or in a Docker container.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinairton/device-domain.git
cd device-domain
```

### Build the Project

Use Maven to build and package the application:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will download all required dependencies and create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

---

## Running the Application Locally

1. Configure your MariaDB database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/device_domain......
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

2. Start the application using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8085`.

---

## Running the Application with Docker

You can use Docker to build and run the application easily. Follow these steps:

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t device-domain .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8085:8085 --name device-domain-container device-domain
```

The application will now be running on `http://localhost:8085`.

---

### Swagger Configuration
By default, SpringDoc OpenAPI auto-configures Swagger for most Spring Boot applications. You can customize Swagger settings if needed, but no manual steps are required for basic setup.

Endpoints enabled by Swagger:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html`
- **OpenAPI Specification**: `http://localhost:8085/v3/api-docs`

---


## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

Tests use the H2 in-memory database.
